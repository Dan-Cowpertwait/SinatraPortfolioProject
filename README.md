Pointlessly Philosophical Pot Plants!

A small sinatra tasking app, designed to give the user a more connected reason to completing things on their to-do list.

Complete a task and your plant will be watered, along with providing the user with a philosophical quote to aid them with daily mindfullness

As you finish tasks, your plant will grow! But don't forget to keep productive or you'll see some unfortunate results. This plant needs water!(and philosophy of course. . . )

To run the program
- make sure you're running ruby 2.6.1
- run bundle install to install the nessessary gems
- run "shotgun" in your console to start your local server.
- navigate to either localhost:9393 or http://127.0.0.1:9393/

Eventually after tidying up the CSS and moving to Ruby on Rails, I may release this on Heroku, but for now, enjoy your Pointlessley Philosphical Pot Plant within Ruby Sinatra <3
